## 🧠 Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally. With advancements in data science, we can analyze patient data to help predict the risk of heart-related conditions. This project implements a classification model using the Decision Tree algorithm to detect heart disease risk based on historical health data.

## ✅ Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm
- Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Predictive system to assist in early detection

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧾 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
